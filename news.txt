At the Sihanoukville port, Cambodia’s major entry point for overseas sea freights, cranes have sprung into action, clocking an average 28 moves per hour from 25 in 2019. Mostly dormant in 2020, port activities improved just a month before the year closed, nudging gross throughput up a marginal 0.83 per cent from a year ago. But total revenue for the unaudited financial year ended December 31, 2020 slipped 17.3 per cent to $73.2 million from $88.4 million in 2019. The top line was also $13 million short of the 2020 revenue target of $86.6 million. Nevertheless, the overall performance is viewed positively by the public-listed entity going by its French name Port Autonome de Sihanoukville (PAS), which saw a sudden spurt in activity in December after the dismal months. “This is a good sign. We expect an uplift in 2021 with gross throughput rising four per cent,” its chairman and CEO Lou Chhun Kim told The Post. To be sure, this feel-good sentiment is not unique to Sihanoukville port alone. It has become apparent in some economic sectors in Cambodia, which echoes a similar upturn in Asia. Analysts put this down to the effective containment of the virus by the governments compared to the rest of the world.
